This is the repository that holds tables and routes for eBay trading, finding and shopping apis

We have the  tables under "tables" directory, and routes under "routes" directory.

We have the dev.json under config where you will need to substitute your values of appname, appid, devname, certaname, authtoken etc.
You can get these values by registering you application on https://www.x.com/developers/ebay

After you get these values, you can start using the tables.

To start the server run "bin/start.sh".

The test directory has examples of the scripts that use the different apis.

For documentation regarding the api, please refer https://www.x.com/developers/ebay
